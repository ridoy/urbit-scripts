# Urbit Scrips

I have a bunch of scripts here for getting English word Urbit planets, planets with specific sigil shapes (full circles, 4 mini circles, playboy bunnies), and additional scripts for processing NFT stuff.

Not too organized but if you're into that kind of thing this is a good starting point.
